MasonX-MiniMVC

MasonX::MiniMVC is about the smallest, simplest MVC framework I could
come up with using Mason.  In fact, all it really provides is a
controller framework and a way of dispatching to controllers from your
dhandler.  You should be able to get it up and running in about 20 lines
of code.

This code is *alpha* level software.  That means it's subject to change
without warning.  If you want me to keep you informed of such changes,
please let me know that you're using it.
